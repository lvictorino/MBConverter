# MBConverter

MBConverter is an utility tool to reorder MBTiles files into X Y hierarchy.

Start MBConverter in your MBTiles directory. A 'dump' directory will be created containing sub directories representing zoom levels. Every zoom directory will contain files named XXX_YYY.png with X:0 and Y:0 on the bottom left. A JSON files named props.json which contains the zoom level size will also be created in every zoom directory.
